"""LongTermMemoryBackend — HTTP-only memory backend.

The backend is the host's :class:`MemoryBackend` implementation,
delegating to a running long-term memory server over HTTP
(``POST /api/v2/memory/{search,add,...}``).

Constructor accepts an explicit ``adapter`` so tests can inject a
fake without monkeypatching module-level imports. Production wiring
goes through :func:`make_backend` -> ``LongTermMemoryBackend(ctx)`` ->
``_make_http_adapter``.

Three architectural invariants worth re-stating:

1. **No compaction.** ``backend.store`` writes to the memory server's index and
   returns. Fitting a session to the model's window is the context engine's
   job, and a separate one.
2. **No ``long_term`` property.** opendde core's :class:`MemoryStore` stays
   where it is: the hand-maintained ``user.md`` the prompt reads. The backend
   is unaware of it.
3. **recall names the track explicitly.** The server takes
   ``owner_type: Literal["user", "agent"]`` explicitly; the host passes
   ``user_id`` XOR ``agent_id`` and the backend forwards the set field
   straight to the server's :class:`SearchRequest`. Neither or both set
   logs a warning and recall returns ``[]``.
